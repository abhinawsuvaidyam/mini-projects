        <h1 class="ab">Qutub minar</h1>
        <p>The ensemble of mosques, minars, and other structures in the Qutb Minar complex is an outstanding testimony
            to
            the
            architectural and artistic achievements of Islamic rulers after they first established their power in the
            Indian
            subcontinent in the 12th century. The complex, located at the southern fringe of New Delhi, illustrates the
            new
            rulers’
            aspiration to transform India from Dar-al-Harb to Dar-al-Islam with the introduction of distinctive building
            types and
            forms.

            Referred to as the Qutb mosque, the Quwwatu’l-Islam, meaning the Might of Islam, introduced to India the
            classic
            model
            of Islamic architecture that had developed in western Asia. The mosque constituted a large rectangular
            courtyard
            enclosed by arcades having carved pillars on three sides and an imposing five-arched screen marking the
            west.
            Incorporating temple elements such as the carved pillars and cladding characteristic of Hindu and Jain
            temples,
            it was
            completed by subsequent rulers – Qutb ud din Aibak and Shamsu’d-Din Iltutmish. Drawing references from their
            Ghurid
            homeland, they constructed a minar (minaret) at the south-eastern corner of the Quwwatu’l-Islam between 1199
            and
            1503,
            thereby completing the vocabulary of a typical classic Islamic mosque. Built of red and buff sandstone and
            eloquently
            carved with inscriptional bands, the Qutb Minar is the tallest masonry tower in India, measuring 72.5 metres
            high, with
            projecting balconies for calling all Muadhdhin to prayer. An iron pillar in the courtyard gave the mosque a
            unique
            Indian aesthetic.

            The 13th-century square tomb of Iltutmish in the north-western part of Quwwatu’l-Islam marks the beginning
            of
            the
            tradition of constructing royal tombs, a practice followed as late as the Mughal era in India. The
            tomb-chamber
            is
            profusely carved with inscriptions and geometrical and arabesque patterns associated with Saracenic
            tradition.
            Expansions made by Allaudin Khilji to the existing ensemble between 1296 and 1311 reflect the power wielded
            by
            the
            monarch. In his short reign, the emperor added a massive ceremonial gateway (Alai Darwaza) south of the Qutb
            Minar, and
            also added a madarsa (place of learning). The first storey of the incomplete Alai Minar, which was envisaged
            to
            be twice
            the scale of the Qutb Minar, stands 25 metres high.

            Criterion (iv): The religious and funerary buildings in the Qutb Minar complex represent an outstanding
            example
            of the
            architectural and artistic achievements of early Islamic India.

            Integrity

            The boundary enveloping the remains of the Qutb and Alai minars, Quwwatu’l-Islam mosque with its extension,
            madarsa of
            Alauddin Khilji, tomb of Iltutmish, Alai Darwaza (ceremonial gateway), Iron Pillar, and other structures is
            of
            adequate
            size to ensure the complete representation of the features and processes that convey the property’s
            significance,
            including the aspiration and vision of the Ghurid clans to establish their rule and religion in India. The
            state
            of
            conservation is stable and the property does not suffer from adverse effects of development and/or neglect.

            The peripheral area of the property has mixed land use, a large tract of green area (Mehrauli Archaeological
            Park), and
            facilities to support visitor movement. No threats to the integrity of the property have been identified by
            the
            State
            Party.

            Authenticity

            The Qutb Minar and its Monuments complex is substantially authentic in terms of its location, forms and
            designs,
            and
            materials and substance. The attributes that sustain the Outstanding Universal Value of the property are
            truthfully and
            credibly expressed, and fully convey the value of the property. To maintain the state of conservation of the
            property,
            repairs undertaken have respected the original construction, architectural, and ornamentation systems that
            demonstrate
            the Outstanding Universal Value of the property. Works periodically undertaken to ensure the property’s
            structural and
            material sustainability are reversible.

            Protection and management requirements

            The Qutb Minar and its Monuments complex is owned by the Government of India and managed by the
            Archaeological
            Survey of
            India (ASI). Its peripheral area is managed by multiple stakeholders, including the ASI, Delhi Development
            Authority,
            Municipal Corporation of Delhi, and Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. The overall
            administration of
            the property and its peripheral area is governed by the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and
            Remains
            Act
            (1958) and its Rules (1959), Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and
            Validation)
            Act
            (2010), Delhi Municipal Corporation Act (1957), Land Acquisition Act (1894), Delhi Urban Art Commission Act
            (1973),
            Urban Land (Sealing and Regulation) Act (1976), Environmental Pollution Control Act (1986), Indian Forest
            Act
            (1927),
            Forest Conservation Act (1980), and Delhi Development Act (1957). Annual funds are provided by the Central
            Government
            for the overall conservation, maintenance, and management of the property.

            The Qutb Minar and its Monuments complex is maintained, monitored, and managed by the ASI Acts and Rules
            through
            an
            annual conservation and development plan. To strengthen the plan, training, researchers, and experts are
            engaged
            to
            ensure high-quality conservation that respects the authenticity of the property. Although there is a
            proposal to
            prepare
            a management plan for the property that includes conservation, integrated development, visitor management,
            and
            interpretation, in the meantime the property is protected under a well-established management system.</p>
